### What I learned

1. how to apply css flexbox.
2. how to add tooltips for buttons.
3. when and where position:realative and position:absolute should be used.
4. the 'element element' 'div p' Selects all <p> elements inside <div> elements selector.
5. the 'element+element' 'div + p' Selects the first <p> element that is placed immediately after <div> elements selector.
6. z-index is effective only when the element has position:relative, absolute, static.
